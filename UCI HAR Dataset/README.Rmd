The script **run_analysis.R** must be run in the same directory as well as train folder and test folder.
And it's does the followsing tasks :
  - 1. Read the all data from the two folders and merges the training and the test sets to create one data set by using **readFolder ** function which read a folder and transform it into data.frame
  - 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  - 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Finally the new dataset in stored **ave_per_activity.csv**
  
  
Note : You can either run directly the run_analysis.R or run CodeBook.Rmd chunk by chunk and they lead to same results
